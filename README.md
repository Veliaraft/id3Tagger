1. Before use next commands for install libraries for python

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

pip install ShazamAPI

pip install mp3-tagger

2. On Linux your need to install ffmpeg utilities.
On Windows append ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe, ffprobe.exe in progam directories
for correctly working.

3. For use - copy files of the program in music directory and run.
The program searches for files on shazam, and making id3 tags for files.
Untagged files being moved in "Untagged" folder.

Using next tags:
- name
- artist
- album
- year
- copyright (aka label)

4. This program does not work correctly as much as shazam does not work correctly.
This is not my error - it just works on shazam platform.
Use backups of music files to avoid tragedies.
